<01100001> Hi, I am setting up rtorrent on my own dedicated server, and am following this tutorial: https://jes.sc/kb/rTorrent+ruTorrent-Seedbox-Guide.php
<01100001> The tutorial suggests that I install xmlrpc-c from source rather than via apt-get (Ubuntu here)
<01100001> Is there any specific reason?
<01100001> According to rtorrent wiki 1.07 or later is needed: https://github.com/rakshasa/rtorrent/wiki/RPC-Setup-XMLRPC -- so why from source and not the ubuntu repositories?
<NoSubstitute> Probably because it wants access to the sources when compiling rtorrent.
<01100001> NoSubstitute: So, would I be absolutely fine with the one from repos? How'd you do it?
<pyroscope> https://bintray.com/pyroscope/rtorrent-ps/rtorrent-ps/view#files
<01100001> pyroscope: Oh thank you very much. I will still try to learn the hard stuff, and if it's too hard (I hope not), I will got with the packages.
<01100001> I read that "XML-RPC is required for communication between rTorrent and ruTorrent." So if I don't plan on using ruTorrent, don't have have to install XML-RPC?
<Lokie> or anything else that uses it like pyroscope's version I guess
<KannOx> 01100001, that's correct, but if you want to use the pyroscope tools (and believe me, you do), you'll need xmlrpc
<01100001> Oh. I want to check out pyroscope tools, but where's the documentation? I couldn't find it; is there any? (for installation and usage)
<KannOx> https://pyrocore.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
<01100001> KannOx: Ok. looks like I'll need to do a lot of reading to understand what Pyroscope does. Which should I go with -- rtorrent + pyroscope or rtorrent-ps?
<01100001> what's your setup like? (do you use ruTorrent?)
<KannOx> rtorrent-ps can be installed separately from pyroscope (and vice versa), but they augment each other
<KannOx> personally i use rtorrent-ps and pyroscope, no rutorrent
<01100001> ok. Will read the docs tonight. I will go with the same setup. Thank you very much!
<01100001> I installed XML-RPC from source following this tutorial: https://jes.sc/kb/rTorrent+ruTorrent-Seedbox-Guide.php#Install-XML-RPC
<01100001> Anyway to check if it installed properly? I've tried `dpkg -s xmlrpc-c`, `dpkg -s xmlrpc` and `dpkg -l '*xml*'`
<01100001> None of them show xmlrpc as installed
<KannOx> you've installed it from source, not using the package manager, so it won't show up in dpkg
<KannOx> `make install` mostly just copies files to different places on your system
<KannOx> you'll know if it's not installed if the `./configure --with-xmlrpc-c` for rtorrent fails
<01100001> Ah, ok!
<01100001> Does rtorrent-ps have any docs like pyrocore does (https://pyrocore.readthedocs.org/) ?
<01100001> I mean other than this: https://code.google.com/p/pyroscope/wiki/RtorrentExtended
<01100001> Also, I am confused as to where I should get the source for rtorrent-ps from. Is it master? I mean, I get the sources for libtorrent and rtorrent from here: http://rakshasa.github.io/rtorrent/
<01100001> I am unsure as to where I'd find the latest stable release of rtorrent-ps
<KannOx> 01100001, there are docs on googlecode, but google decided to change up the formatting for no good reason
<KannOx> if you have vanilla rtorrent already installed, it might be easier to stick with that while things get sorted out
<01100001> Nope. I am just starting out. Nothing's been installed
<01100001> KannOx: What do you mean by "it might be easier to stick with that while things get sorted out"? Do you mean until I learn to install, or is there some problem with rtorrent-ps?
<KannOx> 01100001, you can focus on getting your setup the way you want until the docs are back in a readable state
<KannOx> they're not difficult to follow, it's just that the change in formatting screws up a lot of stuff, and straight up hides some of it
<01100001> I think I can manage with the docs in their current state.
<01100001> I will also look at the source of the docs to see if I am missing anything
<KannOx> alright then have at it :D https://code.google.com/archive/p/pyroscope/wikis/DebianInstallFromSource.wiki#rTorrent_installation
<KannOx> there is no source for googlecode's wikis afaik
<01100001> KannOx: I think there's a copy of it on GitHub
<KannOx> 01100001, link?
<01100001> https://github.com/pyroscope/pyroscope/tree/wiki/
<01100001> https://github.com/pyroscope/pyroscope/blob/wiki/DebianInstallFromSource.md
<01100001> It just occurred to me. Good right?
<KannOx> 01100001, awesome, that's exactly what you want
<KannOx> i didn't think they were up there yet
<01100001> KannOx: From a quick look at the docs... unlike rtorrent which has stable releases, I'd have to go with master branch for rtorrent-ps' source?
<KannOx> 01100001, rtorrent-ps is actually a bunch of patches that get applied against rtorrent
<KannOx> you can pick which version of rtorrent you want to patch during the build process
<01100001> oh ok, guess I need to do more reading... :P


<01100001> As per the wiki docs, it's suggested that I run `./build.sh extend` after `./build.sh all` as it sets up an "extended version with some stability fixes and extension patches" applied. What's that for?
<01100001> Makes me wonder because it's not done by default
<01100001> Also does the build script install XML-RPC from source too? (as it does libtorrent and rtorrent)
<01100001> I guess it does. So forget my last question. (I'd still like an answer for my first.)
<KannOx> 01100001, that "extended version" is rtorrent-ps
<KannOx> first it builds it all vanilla, patches it, then builds it again


<01100001> I am confused about the 'min_peers' setting in rtorrent config. Default is 40 for download. Does that mean if there are only 2 peers (1 seeder, 1 downloader which'd be me) rtorrent wont start downloading?
<01100001> To make my question even simpler... with 'min_peers' set to '40' rtorrent won't start downloading if there's only 1 seed? i.e. no download until seeders+leechers >= 40?
<KannOx> 01100001: the min_peers setting makes rtorrent use more aggressive settings until it finds that number of peers, iirc
<KannOx> so it'll use peers as soon as they appear, but once it hits 40, it will stop hammering the tracker to find more
<01100001> KannOx: So is this understanding wrong? https://www.reddit.com/r/seedboxes/comments/44r6ev/what_do_min_peers_and_max_peers_in_rtorrent/czs8vxf
<KannOx> 01100001: i'm pretty sure that's incorrect, there are other mechanisms for banning bad peers, but that usually relates to bad packets sent and not the speed of the peer
<01100001> KannOx: So based on what you said, rTorrent will be very aggressive about procuring 'min_peers' and gets less aggressive, but is still on the look out for more peers until it reaches 'max_peers' limit? Am I understanding it right?
<KannOx> 01100001: yes, i just traced it back in the source code, that's essentially what it does
<01100001> KannOx: Excellent, that's a relief. Lastly, is there any specific rule/idea that you personally follow to determine the value you set? at least roughly?
<01100001> (I am on a server with 16 GB RAM, 4-core cpu (8 threads) and 3 TB in RAID 1. I can use half the resources for torrenting, so... I am trying to figure out a reasonably good config.)
<KannOx> 01100001: the default is fine, I've lowered mine a bit because many of my torrents have a small (ie <40) number of high-speed peers
<KannOx> for the config as a whole, i'd recommending not changing the defaults unless you actually run into a problem
<KannOx> rtorrent is pretty lightweight, the two main bottleneck are IO and network
<01100001> KannOx: Oh, ok. I will leave it the way it is then and see how it goes.
<KannOx> sometimes the amount of connections spawned can overwhelm low-quality routers, but that's about it
<01100001> hmmm... ok. Thank you very much, KannOx! :D
<KannOx> 01100001: in a weird coicendence, i happen to run rtorrent on 8gb of ram with 2 cores, and I haven't had any resource issues :D

<01100001> Hi, despite doing my best, it's unclear to me as to what the 'untied_directory' rule does.
<01100001> "schedule = untied_directory,5,5,stop_untied="
<01100001> The rule's description says, "stop those that have been deleted."
<01100001> So, when I am adding new torrents, I am to add the .torrent file to both watch and untied directories; rtorrent will automatically add the torrent from watch directory and start doing its thing. When I want to delete the torrent, I am to simply delete the copy of the .torrent file from untied directory?
<01100001> Is that how it works?
<KannOx> 01100001: untied_directory is the name of the scheduled job, it's arbitrary
<KannOx> that job scans all torrents, checks if the torrent file tied to it exists, and stops the torrent if it doesn't
<KannOx> i highly recommend not using that functionality, it's both confusing and annoying
<pyroscope> in short: delete that crap

<01100001> Hi, I have rtorrent installed on a server. The only thing I need is for a way to organize and view torrents (e.g. by tracker or label). Is something like this possible?
<korozion> 01100001: the number keys change the way the list is organized
<korozion> not really sure if that answers your question or not heh
<01100001> korozion: I think what you talking about is sorting. What I am after is for e.g. viewing torrents from a specific tracker or label only.
<01100001> That's not possible I guess?
<Tw|tch> http://community.rutorrent.org/Recipe/Organize%20downloads%20into%20label%20views%20and%20rotate%20through%20them
<01100001> Tw|tch: I will give it a shot, thanks

<01100001> Hi. Under ~/lib/rtorrent-0.9.6/bin/ what do binaries rtorrent-vanilla, rtorrent, and rtorrent-extended represent? 1. unpatched/original version of rTorrent; 2. original version of rTorrent with patches applied from rTorrent-PS project; 3. rTorrent-PS binary; respectively. Correct?
<01100001> Hmm... looking at the build script's code, it looks like this now: (1) `rtorrent-vanilla` is the unpatched/original version of rTorrent; (2) Both `rtorrent` and `rtorrent-extended` are the same, and represent rTorrent-PS AKA rTorrent Extended binary. Amirite?
<01100001> Also, is it pyroscope or pyrocore?
<KannOx> 01100001, rtorrent is the most recent binary build, ignore it
<KannOx> use the ~/bin/ symlinks to run things
<KannOx> pyroscope has been the name for longer so i say it out of habit, but maybe he's tired of getting highlighted all the time :D
<01100001> lol
<01100001> So, I don't understand the diff between rtorrent-vanilla and rtorrent (also I checked, rtorrent and rtorrent-extended are the same files; yours is contradicting this finding)
<01100001> I am just trying to understand each step of the process as best as I can, that's all.
<KannOx> both build processes make an rtorrent binary, which is copied to rtorrent-vanilla or rtorrent-extended depending on which one you built
<01100001> Ah, now it makes sense. So when I run `./build.sh all` `rtorrent` binary is copied to `rtorrent-vanilla`, and when I run `./build.sh extend` the new `rtorrent` binary is copied to `rtorrent-extended`; that's it?
<KannOx> yes

<01100001> Hi, aren't max_peers and max_uploads settings conflicting? I mean, if I set max_peers to 40, rTorrent will connect me to a max of 40 downloaders which mean I can make max 40 uploads at a time. Isn't it? What am I missing here?
<pyroscope> related != conflicting
<01100001> pyroscope: How?
<01100001> I mean, how'd I be able to upload to 100 people per torrent if I am limiting peers to 40?
<01100001> correction: how'd I be able to make up to 100 uploads per torrent if I am limiting peers to 40?
<01100001> isn't that conflicting? or I am missing the point, in which case I'd like to know what it is.
<pyroscope> the point is one is for the scrape, the other a client setting
<01100001> *reading https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracker_scrape
<01100001> pyroscope: Ok. So, rtorrent max/min_peers settings send a quick scrape request to the tracker? And the client setting you are referring to is max_uploads? Or is it the other way around?
<01100001> Googling didn't help either; nothing good to read on this
<pyroscope> read the docs, err, source
<KannOx> 01100001: min/max_peers controls the aggressiveness of scraping to find peers, max_uploads controls how many peer connections are allowed to be made for uploading

<01100001> Hi, I created a tmux session with rtorrent running using this command: `tmux -2u new -s rtorrent -n rtorrent1 "~/rtorrent1/start; exec bash"`
<01100001> What'd be a proper way to restart rtorrent now? (rTorrent-PS actually)
<01100001> This is how I just did it. (1) `ctrl+q` to kill rtorrent (wait till rtorrent closes properly and bash shell is shown); (2) `ctrl+a d` to detatch from tmux; (3) `tmux kill-ses -t rtorrent` to kill tmux session; (4) Run  `tmux -2u new -s rtorrent -n rtorrent1 "~/rtorrent1/start; exec bash"` again. This good?
<KannOx> did you give rtorrent time to shutdown properly before killing the session?
<KannOx> in general, if you can avoid killing any processes, that's the better approach
<01100001> KannOx: No I didn't give it time. There are no torrents in it anyway. I am just playing with it. But how'd I know how much time to give?
<KannOx> by waiting until rtorrent exits and goes back to the shell
<01100001> Oh, that it did.
<KannOx> at which point you should exit out of the bash shell instead of killing
<01100001> yes, it exactly went that way
[...]
<pR0Ps> 01100001: Try this: tmux send-keys -t rtorrent1:rtorrent.0 C-q && while pidof rtorrent > /dev/null; do sleep 0.5`
<pR0Ps> That will send a "ctrl+q" to the rtorrent process in the rtorrent1 session then wait until it stops
<pR0Ps> This gives it a chance to shut down nicely
<KannOx> i'm pretty sure sending two Ctrl-qs will cause it to not shutdown nicely
<pR0Ps> KannOx: yeah, 2 ctrl-q's does a force quit but just one waits until everything is finished up before exiting.
<pyroscope> pR0Ps:  except you're missing a ;done
<KannOx> pR0Ps, yep, just misread the command
<pR0Ps> whoops, yep, definitely needs "; done" on the end
SO THE CORRECT COMMAND IS (PROBABLY):
`tmux send-keys -t rtorrent1:rtorrent.0 C-q && while pidof rtorrent > /dev/null; do sleep 0.5; done`

<01100001> "Deluge is agressive," "Deluge is aggressive with finding peers," "Deluge finds faster peers very quickly after a torrent is added," etc. etc. Do statements such as these hold any truth? I mean, what does Deluge do differently compared to other clients e.g. rtorrent, that makes it better for seeding? (People claim they upload more with Deluge...)
<hyper_ch> people claim a lot of things
<hyper_ch> you can also make rtorrent grab more peers
<hyper_ch> but in the end it's the tracker's decision how many peers are being handed out
<01100001> I just found this: http://www.torrent-invites.com/showthread.php?t=79685&p=726459&viewfull=1#post726459
<01100001> And that's the only thing I could find as to how Deluge is agressive.
<hyper_ch> November 13th, 2010, 09:29 PM
<01100001> hyper_ch: So, are we talking about min/max_peers and max_uploads in rtorrent config.? Weren't they available back then?
<01100001> or what do you mean by that timestamp?
<KannOx> i've heard deluge lies about about how many chunks/peers it needs or something, although i've never seen anyone point to documentation or source code
<KannOx> generally the conclusions i've seen say that deluge gets more initial upload but doesn't scale well and is less suited to long term seeding
<KannOx> YMMV, as in all things
<01100001> hmm...

<01100001> Ok, so which font shows all the symbols shown here: http://i.imgur.com/zbAT9.png
<01100001> o_O
<01100001> I am trying to get putty (Windows) to show all symbols; no luck so far
<01100001> Oh nevermind! https://github.com/pyroscope/pyroscope/blob/wiki/RtorrentExtendedCanvas.md#setting-up-your-terminal
<pyroscope>  there is more in some recent issue
<01100001> Ah got it: https://github.com/pyroscope/rtorrent-ps/issues/8

<01100001> Hi, I am trying to reseed some torrents. How do I tell rtorrent where to look (base path) when adding a torrent?
<01100001> (The location of the file is different from the downloads directory.)
<hyper_ch> ctrl-k, ctrl-o, ctrl-r, ctrl-s
<01100001> hyper_ch: Excellent! Was thinking I'd have to use a command :P
<hyper_ch> stop, set new base dir, rehash, start
<01100001> got it, thank you very much

<01100001> hard links vs symbolic links cross-seeding torrents? (Setting base location for each torrent is proving very difficult when reseeding a bunch of torrents. So instead I can have hard/sym links of the files where the torrent client will look for them by default.)
<01100001> which one would you guys recommend?
<01100001> I am asking because, I know either would work, but I might be missing some edge cases.
<hyper_ch> no edge cases IMHO
<01100001> hyper_ch, ok, going with sym links then
