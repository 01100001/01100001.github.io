title: Why Use A Server For Video Encoding And Where To Get One?
---

Video encoding (and re-encoding) can be pretty stressful to a PC, and considering that I have only one, and a 4-year old one at that, and don't expect to get a new one any time soon, I have to be a bit more careful with my PC. Also, depending upon the specs, it can be very time consuming.

So for now, it makes sense for me to learn and do encoding on a server as it'd not only be faster (depending upon the specs of course) but also allows my PC to live a little longer. Plus, I can do my 'actual' work, one that pays me, while the video is being encoded, which I doubt I'd be able to do on my PC.

You can get dedicated servers dirt cheap on:

- [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.de/ot/hosting/), or its server auctioning site [serverbidding.com](http://www.serverbidding.com/?country=OTHER)

- [OVH](https://www.ovh.ie/), or its brands [SoyouStart](https://www.soyoustart.com/ie/) and [Kimsufi](https://www.kimsufi.com/en/)

- [Online.net](https://www.online.net/en/dedicated-server)

- [LeaseWeb](https://www.leaseweb.com/dedicated-servers/build-your-own) (look for those "On Sale")

All of these are large hosting service providers and are based in Europe. And as I am from Asia, I noticed that it's cheaper for me to set the currency on the sites to EUR (€), as the currency conversion works in my favor, and there's no VAT. Watchout for one-time setup fees though!

If for some reason you prefer a VPS instead, I'd recommend [Linode](https://www.linode.com/pricing). Their server performance kicks ass.

As for me, I got mine through Hetzner server auction. [It's quite beefy]({{ baseurl }}/colophon/) for my needs, all metal, and costs me €32/month.

It's just been a few days, so I don't have much to say yet. But so far, so good.
